### Description of the project

All the points of the project are contained in a single main file called `HW4_main.ipynb`.

### 1. Recommendation sytem
This part tries to take those movies highlighted by the users (the top 10 best for each user) and by means of hashing techniques, represent each user with the genres in a matrix where it will be indicated with a binary answer if that user corresponds to one genre or another. Subsequently, the minhasging signatures matrix will be created, so that at the end a LSH will be performed to obtain the two most similar users to a given user and will recommend 5 movies based on this.

### 2. Grouping Users together!


### 3. Bonus Question


### 4. Command Line Question


### 5. Algorithmic Question
